This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—using machine learning techniques based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset from scikit-learn is used, which contains four features and a balanced distribution of 150 samples. The data is first explored and visualized to understand feature relationships, then split into training and testing sets with feature scaling applied for better model performance. Two classification models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. To ensure model reliability, 5-fold cross-validation is performed, and Random Forest hyperparameters are optimized using GridSearchCV. The results show high classification accuracy, with Setosa being perfectly classified and minor overlap between Versicolor and Virginica, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning models in solving multi-class classification problems.
